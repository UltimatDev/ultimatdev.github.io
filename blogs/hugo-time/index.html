<p>Hugo, hugo, hugo&hellip;. üòí-&gt;üòÅ is what i would describe My journery through the &ldquo;Wonderous&rdquo; world of hugo as&hellip;. i did the task twice and it has been a headache but right now as i am typing this, the entire thing seems so easy and clean like dammmnnn&hellip;.this is all you gotta do to get a blog up and running&hellip;.. anyways i&rsquo;ll talk about both attempts seperately</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="attempt-1">Attempt-1</h2>
<p>I started by looking up what hugo is then  browsing thrugh their site, lookin&rsquo; at themes and then looked up how to set up hugo and making blogs with it.e..
i followed two vids actually (technically 1 since one of it is a large playlist):-</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtIqKaDlqXo&amp;list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3"><img src="image/youtube_logo.png" alt="image"></a> <strong>Girrafe Academy/ Hugo - Static Site Generator | Tutorial</strong></p>
<p>i started this till tut-8(archetypes) i believe&hellip; the only reason i started was coz he was installing it in windows and i wanted to try out hugo in windows too..he explained it nycc but was very slow</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/LIFvgrRxdt4?si=q9yLcWihzTXdP0Hnm"><img src="image/youtube_logo.png" alt="image"></a>  <strong>Creating a Blog with Hugo and Github in 10 minutes</strong></p>
<p>I followed this guy then for a bit of time&hellip; i made a website from this but still had some issues that i had to work on so i restarted from scratch</p>

<h2 id="attempt-2">Attempt-2</h2>
<p>I remade the needed repositories and started working on hugo</p>
<p>this time i used the official website to learn how to do&hellip; this time it works real fine&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo Official introduction</a></p>
<p>this site led me through the basics and perfected my idea of how to use hugo and to utilise it to its maximum potential(or as much as i could have learned in the short span of time)</p>
