  <p>Hi I am Varun..</p>
<p>i could leave my intro at that, but since i hate leaving things empty here is what is to be noted about me</p>
<p>My name is Varun.V, As mentioned in my repo, i hail from ernakulam, specificaly tripunithura&hellip;i like to make dark jokes(only with people who i am sure can handle them&hellip; things get too dark too fast)&hellip;i like to spend a lot of my time watching netflix(as we all do unfortunately(or fortunately)) and listening to music(dont ask genre )&hellip;I absolutely adore doing Model UN&rsquo;s(with a same burning passion as i reserve for coding)..that is pretty much it, i guess, as You cant sum up a person in a paragraph but still you get the gist right&hellip;</p>
<p>Previous Projects:-</p>
<p>AI</p>
<p>I have done on project in connection with a workshop organized but Intel called AI4YOUTH. It consisted of two phases&hellip; one was to learn how to make AI including chatbots, trying out nueral networks etc.</p>
<p>The second phase was a project called tweet classifier/ Sentiment classifier. as the name suggests its used to analyse tweets for better filtering of your twitter feed(oh sorry X). This was a mentor-mentee kind of program.</p>
<p>Game Dev</p>
<p>I have made games in unity(haven&rsquo;t published any)&hellip;the largest project i worked on was to make a Maze Runner game that was to be integrated into our schoolstech fest.</p>
<p>Python</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done projects mostly based on tkinter&hellip;i dont know if i can technically call this mine but just to add&hellip;my school project at the end of 12th was a social media search engine- you input a person or organisation and it webscrapes the google results, returns the top results and then it displays only social media links</p>
<p>My main projects(Unfinished as well) are already listed in my github page</p>
<p>my other social media pages are a joke so i am only available in the following:-</p>
